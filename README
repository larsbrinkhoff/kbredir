These embryonic programs are used to send keyboard events from a
source to a destination.

Sources currently supported are:
	* Characters and VT220 key sequences from stdin
	* Raw keyboard events from Linux console
	* xev output
(maybe:	* X11 display)

Destinations currently supported are:
	* Characters and VT220 key sequences to stdout
	* X11 display using XSendEvent
	* X11 display using the XTest extension
(maybe:	* Linux console)

Usage: hack the source code to your liking, and type 'make' to build
the programs.  The read_* programs read various keyboard devices and
writes events to stdout, and the write_* programs send keyboard events
read from stdin.

Example:
	read_vt220 | write_xtest
